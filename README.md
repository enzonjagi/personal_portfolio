# A Django Portfolio Project

## Quoted from [Django Portfolio Project on Real Python](https://realpython.com/get-started-with-django-1/)
<p>Before you get started with any web development project, it’s a good idea to come up with a plan of what you’re going to build. In this tutorial, we are going to build an application with the following features:</p>

### A fully functioning blog: 
* To demonstrate coding ability. 
* In this application, we create, update, and delete blog posts. 
* Posts will have categories that can be used to sort them. Finally, users will be able to leave comments on posts.

### A portfolio of your work: 
* A showcase of previous web development projects. 
* By building a gallery style page with clickable links to projects that I’ve completed.
